<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The <b>caGrid iPhone Application</b> is a native iPhone interface to the caGrid. 
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
This application is divided into tabs, visible at the bottom of the screen. The tabs provide the following functionality:
</p>

<h3>Search</h3>
<p>
The main screen allows you to execute keyword searches on the grid. First, choose a data type to search within. 
Then, select some services to search and type in your search terms. When you submit 
the search you will be taken to the Results tab to monitor the search progress.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
Use the Results tab to check up on your running searches, and see their results. Grid searches may take some time to complete, 
so you are free to do other things while the search is running, even exit and come back later. Your results will 
only be stored on the server for a few hours however, so don't wait too long to check back and download them.
</p>

<h3>Services</h3>
<p>
Here you can view all the services on the grid, and find ones that interest you. Tap the blue arrow to see details about the service. 
If you find a server you like, add it to your favorites for quick access later.
</p>

<h3>Hosts</h3>
<p>
Similar to the Services tab, here you can view all the hosting institutions with services on the grid. 
For each host you can tap the "Services" button to see all the services it is hosting. 
</p>

<h3>Favorites</h3>
<p>
Quick access to your favorite services and hosts. Mark your favorites in the Services and Hosts tabs.
